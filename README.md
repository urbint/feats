# feats
helpers on top of sklearn featurization pipelines basically two files, `features_pipeline.py` has all the logic for constructing complex, config-driven featurization pipelines, and `demo.py` which gives a small demo how these pipelines might be used. 


## To Run the Demo:
1. first build the virtual environment, tested under anaconda py 3.5: `source scripts/setup.sh`
2. `.virtualenv/bin/python -m feats.demo`
